  "ingredients": [
    "One 10-ounce can diced tomatoes with green chiles",
    "1 cup raw cashews",
    "1 teaspoon ground cumin",
    "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
    "1 teaspoon onion powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon chili powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder",
    "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper",
    "Kosher salt",
    "1/4 cup nutritional yeast",
    "1 tablespoon chopped jarred roasted red peppers, drained",
    "1/2 tablespoon distilled white vinegar",
    "2 teaspoons hot sauce",
    "1 small jalapeno, thinly sliced, seeds removed if desired",
    "2 tablespoons cilantro leaves",

  ],
  "steps": [
    "Place a fine-mesh sieve over a large liquid measuring cup. Pour the tomatoes with green chiles into the sieve and press with a spatula to squeeze out all the liquid (about 1/2 cup). Put the tomatoes with green chiles into a small bowl and set aside.",
    "Combine the reserved liquid, cashews, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, turmeric, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt and 3/4 cup water in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook, stirring occasionally, until the cashews are tender, about 10 minutes.",
    "Transfer the mixture to a high-powered blender. Add the nutritional yeast, roasted red peppers, vinegar, hot sauce, 2 tablespoons of the reserved tomatoes with green chiles and 1 cup water. Blend until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed.",
    "Transfer the mixture back to the skillet. Heat gently over low heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened and scoopable, about 10 minutes.",
