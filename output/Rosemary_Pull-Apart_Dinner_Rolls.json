  "ingredients": [
    "1 package active dry yeast",
    "0.25 cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))",
    "1 cup milk",
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "1 tablespoon honey",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary leaves",
    "0.5 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 egg",
    "1 teaspoon milk",
    "coarse sea salt to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": "Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Set aside in a warm place until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 10 to 15 minutes.\nCombine 1 cup milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook until butter is melted, 3 to 4 minutes; remove pan from heat.\nCombine 2 cups flour, yeast mixture, honey, 1 teaspoon salt, rosemary, and milk mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook; mix on low until no dry spots remain. Stir in 1/2 cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition. Continue adding flour until a firm dough forms that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Knead on medium until elastic and soft but still tacky, about 6 minutes. Transfer dough to a clean bowl and coat with olive oil. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\nTransfer dough to a work surface and shape into a rectangle about 1-inch thick. Cut into 36 equally-sized pieces. Form each piece into a ball, pinching the seams on the underside, creating a smooth, round top.\nLightly beat egg with 1 teaspoon milk in a small bowl.\nTransfer dough balls to the prepared baking sheet in 3 rows of 12, placing them close together but not touching. Brush tops lightly with the egg mixture and sprinkle with sea salt. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, 20 to 30 minutes.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.",
