  "ingredients": [
    "4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves",
    "salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
    "2 large eggs",
    "1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed",
    "0.75 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided",
    "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed",
    "0.5 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed",
    "0.5 cup prepared tomato sauce",
    "0.25 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes",
    "0.25 cup chopped fresh basil",
    "0.5 cup grated provolone cheese",
    "2 teaspoons olive oil"
  ],
  "instructions": "Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nPlace chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.\nSeason chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer, sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.\nBeat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.\nHeat 1/2 inch of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in batches, so you do not overcrowd the pan, until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.\nTransfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let chicken rest briefly before serving.",
