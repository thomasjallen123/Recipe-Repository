  "ingredients": [
    "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1 1/3 pounds chicken breast tenders, cut into 1-inch pieces",
    "Salt and pepper",
    "1 1/2 tablespoons butter",
    "4 cloves garlic, chopped",
    "2 shallots, chopped",
    "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
    "1/2 cup white wine",
    "1 lemon, juiced",
    "1 cup chicken broth or stock",
    "3 tablespoons capers, drained",
    "1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped",
    "1 pound penne rigate pasta, cooked to al dente",

  ],
  "steps": [
    "Heat a deep nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and the chicken to the pan. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Brown chicken until lightly golden all over, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove chicken from pan and return the skillet to the heat. Reduce heat to medium. Add another tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter, the garlic and shallots to the skillet. Saute garlic and shallots 3 minutes. Add flour and cook 2 minutes. Whisk in wine and reduce liquid 1 minute. Whisk lemon juice and broth into sauce. Stir in capers and parsley. When the liquid comes to a bubble, add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to the sauce to give it a little shine. Add chicken back to the pan and heat through, 1 to 2 minutes. Toss hot pasta with chicken and sauce and serve. Adjust salt and pepper, to your taste. Top with fresh snipped chives."
