  "ingredients": [
    "0.5 cup soy sauce",
    "0.333 cup honey",
    "0.333 cup ketchup",
    "0.333 cup brown sugar",
    "0.25 cup Chinese rice wine",
    "2 tablespoons hoisin sauce",
    "2 tablespoons red bean curd",
    "1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder",
    "2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins"
  ],
  "instructions": "Gather all ingredients.\nStir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red bean curd, and five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes.\nMeanwhile, slice each pork tenderloin lengthwise into 1 ½- to 2-inch-thick strips. Place pork strips in a large, resealable plastic bag.\nPour marinade into the bag with the pork. Squeeze air from the bag, seal, and turn the bag a few times until pork is well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.\nWhen ready to cook, preheat a charcoal grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Set aside the remaining marinade for basting.\nRake the hot coals into two equal piles on opposite sides of the charcoal grate. Add a small container of water to the grate. Place pork strips in the center of the grate for indirect cooking.\nCook pork over indirect heat, turning regularly and basting as desired, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 30 minutes or longer.\nServe hot and enjoy!",
