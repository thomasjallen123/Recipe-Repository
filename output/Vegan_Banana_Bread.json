  "cook_minutes": 60,
  "ingredients": [
    "Cooking spray",
    "1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "3 very ripe medium bananas, mashed (about 1 1/4 cups)",
    "3/4 cup sugar",
    "1/2 cup plain soy milk yogurt",
    "1/2 cup vegetable oil",
    "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom and two long sides of a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan with parchment, leaving a 2-inch overhang on each long side, and lightly coat with cooking spray.",
    "Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. Whisk the bananas, sugar, yogurt, oil and vanilla together in another medium bowl. Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until the batter just comes together (it's OK if there are lumps). Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan and bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes; tent the loaf with foil if it is browning too quickly. Cool the loaf in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then lift it from the pan by the parchment overhangs and cool completely on the rack. Store the loaf in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days."
