  "ingredients": [
    "100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers",
    "1.75 pounds ground pork",
    "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root",
    "4 cloves garlic, minced",
    "2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion",
    "4 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "3 tablespoons sesame oil",
    "1 egg, beaten",
    "5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage"
  ],
  "instructions": "Combine pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage in a large bowl. Stir until well mixed.\nPlace 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling in the center of each wonton wrapper. Moisten edges with water and fold over to form a triangle. Press edges firmly to seal. Keep filled dumplings covered with a damp towel to prevent drying out until ready to cook.\nArrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer lined with parchment, making sure they're not touching to prevent them from sticking together; steam over simmering water until pork is cooked through, about 15 minutes.\nServe hot and enjoy!",
