- **Prep:** 15 min
- **Cook:** 20 min

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 stalks celery, finely diced
- 3/4 cup chopped scallions
- 3/4 cup dried cranberries
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage
- 4 slices potato bread, cubed (about 2 1/2 cups)
- 1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- 4 bone-in center-cut pork chops (about 3 pounds)
- 3 tablespoons heavy cream

## Steps

1. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the celery and scallions and cook until slightly softened, 2 minutes.
2. Add the cranberries and sage and cook 2 minutes.
3. Add the bread and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes.
4. Add 1/2 cup chicken broth and the parsley and stir until the broth is absorbed, 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper; transfer to a bowl.
5. Wipe out the skillet.
6. Holding a knife parallel to the cutting board, cut a deep 2-inch-wide pocket into the side of each pork chop. Season the chops on both sides with salt and pepper and fill the pockets evenly with the stuffing.
7. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chops and cook until golden brown, 2 minutes per side.
8. Add 1/2 cup chicken broth; reduce the heat to medium low. Cover and cook until the chops are cooked through, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to plates.
9. Add the remaining 3/4 cup broth and the cream to the skillet and increase the heat to medium high. Simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
10. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Season with salt and pepper.
11. Pour over the chops and serve.
