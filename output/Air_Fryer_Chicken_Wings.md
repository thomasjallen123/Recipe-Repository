- **Yields:** 4 servings
- **Total:** 40 min
- **Cook:** 20 min

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds chicken wings, split at the joint and tips removed
- Kosher salt
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup hot sauce, such as Frank's RedHot
- Ranch or blue cheese dressing, for serving

## Steps

1. Pat the chicken wings dry and sprinkle generously with salt. Place the wings in the basket of a 3.5-quart air fryer so they are not touching (if necessary to fit, line up the drumettes standing upright along the sides). Set the air fryer to 360 degrees F and cook for 12 minutes, then flip the wings with tongs and cook for 12 minutes more. Flip the wings again, increase the heat to 390 degrees F and cook until the outsides are extra-crispy, about 6 minutes more.
2. Meanwhile, warm the butter in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until melted, about 1 minute. Whisk in the hot sauce.
3. Toss the wings with the butter mixture to coat in a large bowl and serve with dressing on the side.
