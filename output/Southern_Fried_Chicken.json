  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup all-purpose flour",
    "1 teaspoon paprika",
    "salt to taste",
    "ground black pepper to taste",
    "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
    "1 teaspoon onion powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)",
    "1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces",
    "1 quart vegetable oil for frying"
  ],
  "instructions": "Gather all ingredients.\nCombine flour, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken pieces to the bag and toss to coat.\nPlace floured chicken pieces on a wire rack set over a baking sheet, reserving remaining flour in bag. Chill chicken in the refrigerator 45 minutes or until flour looks pasty.\nMeanwhile, add 1 ½ inches of oil to a deep fryer or 5-quart heavy pot. Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace chicken pieces back into the bag of flour and toss once more to coat. This will help the coating cling nicely to the chicken pieces for crispier results. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C).\nLower chicken pieces, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, carefully into the hot oil. Fry until golden, turning once, about 8 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nTransfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Keep fried chicken warm in preheated oven while you fry remaining chicken.\nServe hot and enjoy!",
