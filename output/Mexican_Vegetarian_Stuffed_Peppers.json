  "ingredients": [
    "1 tablespoon salt",
    "4 large green bell peppers - tops, seeds, and membranes removed",
    "1 tablespoon olive oil",
    "0.5 cup chopped onion",
    "2 cups cooked rice",
    "1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed",
    "1 (14.5 ounce) can chili-style diced tomatoes",
    "1 teaspoon chili powder",
    "1 teaspoon garlic salt",
    "0.5 teaspoon ground cumin",
    "0.5 teaspoon salt",
    "1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend (such as Sargento® Authentic Mexican)"
  ],
  "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Add green bell peppers and cook until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. This will prevent the bell peppers from becoming crispy as they bake.\nDrain bell peppers and arrange cut-side up in a 9x9-inch baking dish.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.\nTransfer cooked onion into a large bowl; add rice, black beans, and tomatoes. Stir in chili powder, garlic salt, cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until well combined. Fold in 1 1/2 cups Mexican cheese blend.\nSpoon rice mixture evenly into bell peppers; sprinkle with remaining Mexican cheese blend.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 30 minutes.",
