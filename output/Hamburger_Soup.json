  "ingredients": [
    "2 1/2 pounds ground chuck",
    "3 cloves garlic, minced",
    "2 stalks celery, diced",
    "1 large onion, diced",
    "3 cups beef stock or broth, plus more if needed",
    "One 14.5-ounce can whole tomatoes",
    "3 tablespoons tomato paste",
    "2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground oregano",
    "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste",
    "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste",
    "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste",
    "5 red potatoes, cut into chunks",
    "4 carrots, peeled and sliced on the diagonal",
    "1 green bell pepper, seeded and diced",
    "1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced",
    "1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced",
    "Crusty bread, for serving"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "In a large pot over medium-high heat, brown the meat with the garlic, celery and onions. Remove the pot from the heat and drain off as much fat as you can. (Discard the fat once it cools.)",
    "Return the pot to the heat and add the beef stock, tomatoes, tomato paste, parsley, oregano, salt, black pepper, cayenne, potatoes, carrots and green, red and yellow bell peppers. Stir to combine, then bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover the pot and simmer until the potatoes are tender but not overly mushy, 15 to 20 more minutes. The soup should be somewhat thick, but if you'd like it to be more \"soupy,\" add 1 to 2 cups more broth OR hot water and heat through. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt, black pepper or cayenne if needed.",
    "Serve with crusty bread!"
