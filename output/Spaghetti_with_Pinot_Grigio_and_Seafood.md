## Ingredients

- 1 pound spaghetti pasta
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 shallots, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
- 1 1/2 cup Pinot Grigio (or other white wine)
- 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 pounds clams, washed
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 cups arugula

## Steps

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta.
2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and the garlic and cook for 3 minutes, until tender but not brown. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and cook for another minute. Add the wine, shrimp, and clams. Bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the shrimp are pink and the clams have opened, about 7 minutes.
3. Add the spaghetti to the seafood mixture. Add the salt and pepper and stir to combine. Add the arugula. Stir gently and place on a serving platter. Serve immediately.
