  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs)",
    "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan",
    "2 large eggs",
    "6 boneless pork loin chops, pounded thin to 1/3 inch-thick (1 1/2 pounds total)",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "6 lemon wedges"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.",
    "Coarsely crush the panko into a large shallow bowl. Stir the cheese into the panko. Lightly beat the eggs in another large shallow bowl. Sprinkle the pork generously with salt and pepper. Dip the pork, 1 piece at a time, in the egg, allowing the excess to drip off, then dredge the pork in the crumb mixture, patting to coat completely. Place the pork on a small baking sheet.",
    "Heat 1/4 cup of oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the pork to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain, then transfer them to a clean baking sheet and keep them warm in the oven. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil to the skillet and fry the remaining pork.",
    "Transfer the pork to plates and serve with lemon wedges."
