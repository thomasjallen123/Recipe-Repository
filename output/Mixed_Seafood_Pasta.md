## Ingredients

- Kosher salt
- 1 pound fettuccine
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 8 ounces peeled and deveined large shrimp
- 8 ounces lobster meat, cut into chunks
- 8 ounces calamari, sliced
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup jarred sun-dried tomato strips packed in oil
- 2 tablespoons capers, drained
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 red onion, finely diced
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2 cups baby spinach leaves
- 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped, plus more for garnish
- Zest of 1 lemon, plus more for garnish

## Steps

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package instructions for al dente.
2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, lobster and calamari and season with salt and pepper. Sear on each side for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Remove to a plate and set aside.
3. Add the tomato strips, capers, thyme, rosemary, garlic and onion to the skillet and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring often to ensure the vegetables don't brown. Deglaze with the white wine, then add the cream. Bring to a simmer and allow the sauce to simmer and thicken about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Add the spinach to the sauce and stir so it begins to wilt. Drain the cooked pasta and add it to the skillet. Add the seafood and any juices on the plate. Add the Parmesan, parsley and lemon zest, turn off the heat and toss everything together until nicely coated in the sauce. Garnish the pasta with more Parmesan, parsley and lemon zest. Serve directly from the skillet.
