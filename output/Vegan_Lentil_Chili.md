## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal, light- and dark-green parts separated
- 1 red bell pepper (about 6 ounces), diced
- 1 orange bell pepper (about 6 ounces), diced
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ancho chile powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- Two 14.5-ounce cans diced tomatoes with their juices
- 1 cup dried red lentils
- Two 14.5-ounce cans kidney beans, drained and rinsed
- 2 cups frozen diced butternut squash (from a 10-ounce bag)
- 1 tablespoon agave syrup or maple syrup
- Assorted garnishes such as thinly sliced radish and jalapeno, cubed avocado and pepitas, for serving

## Steps

1. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy-bottom pot over medium-high heat. Add the light-green scallion parts, both bell peppers, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the tomato paste, garlic, ancho chile powder, cumin and cinnamon and cook, stirring, until the tomato paste darkens in color and the garlic is softened, about 1 minute.
2. Add the tomatoes and their juices, lentils, 2 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper to the pot and stir to combine. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the temperature and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the lentils have softened, 12 to 15 minutes. Fold in the kidney beans, butternut squash and agave syrup and cook, stirring once or twice, until the squash is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Serve the chili in bowls and garnish with the radish, jalapeno, avocado, pepitas and dark-green scallion parts as desired.
