  "ingredients": [
    "1/4 cup sugar",
    "1/3 cup tamari or soy sauce",
    "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons grated ginger",
    "Kosher salt",
    "12 ounces sweet potato vermicelli, cellophane noodles or angel hair pasta",
    "2 tablespoons grapeseed oil",
    "4 ounces oyster mushrooms, sliced into 1-inch pieces",
    "4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps quartered",
    "1 large shallot, chopped",
    "1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips",
    "2 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped",
    "3 scallions, cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
    "6 leaves kale, cut into 1-inch pieces",
    "Sesame seeds, toasted, for garnish, optional"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "For the sauce: Combine the sugar, tamari, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil and ginger in a small bowl. Whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside.",
    "For the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and stir to help submerge them. Cook until the noodles are just barely cooked, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Using kitchen shears or a clean pair of scissors, cut the noodles into approximately 8-inch lengths. Set aside.",
    "Heat the grapeseed oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the oyster and shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, for about 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are beginning to brown. Add the shallots and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until fragrant, another 2 minutes. Add the red pepper, garlic and scallions to the pan, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for an additional 3 minutes, or until the peppers are beginning to soften. Add the kale and the cooked noodles and saute another 3 minutes, stirring often to coat the noodles in the oil and to wilt the kale. Add the sauce and toss to coat. Top with sesame seeds if desired."
