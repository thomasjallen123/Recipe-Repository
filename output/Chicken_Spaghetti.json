  "ingredients": [
    "1 whole raw chicken, cut into 8 pieces",
    "1 pound thin spaghetti, broken into 2-inch pieces",
    "2 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar",
    "1/4 cup finely diced green bell pepper",
    "1/4 cup finely diced red bell pepper",
    "1 teaspoon seasoned salt",
    "1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper",
    "Two 10 3/4-ounce cans cream of mushroom soup",
    "1 medium onion, finely diced",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the chicken pieces to the boiling water and boil for a few minutes, then return the heat to medium-low and simmer, 30 to 45 minutes.",
    "Remove the chicken and 2 cups of the chicken cooking broth from the pot. When the chicken is cool, remove the skin and pick out the meat (a mix of dark and white) to make 2 generous cups.",
    "Cook the spaghetti in the same chicken cooking broth until al dente. Do not overcook. When the spaghetti is cooked, combine with the chicken, mushroom soup, 1 1/2 cups cheese, the green peppers, red peppers, onions, seasoned salt, cayenne, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir in 1 cup of the reserved chicken cooking broth, adding an additional cup if needed.",
    "Place the mixture in a casserole pan and top with the remaining 1 cup cheese. Cover and freeze up to 6 months, cover and refrigerate up to 2 days or bake immediately until bubbly, about 45 minutes. (If the cheese on top starts to get too cooked, cover with foil)."
