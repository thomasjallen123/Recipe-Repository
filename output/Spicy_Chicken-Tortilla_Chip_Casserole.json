    "Position a rack in the upper third of the oven; preheat to 400 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the scallions and garlic and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour, cumin, oregano and cayenne and stir until coated. Add the chicken broth and heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the salsa and remove from the heat. Stir in the chicken, white beans and 1 cup cilantro.",
