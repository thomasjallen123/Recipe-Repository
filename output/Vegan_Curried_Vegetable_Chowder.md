## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 medium leeks, white and light-green parts only, halved and thinly sliced (about 1 cup)
- 2 large carrots, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks
- Kosher salt
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons curry powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- One 13.5-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- Zest and juice of 1 lime (zest removed in strips with a vegetable peeler), plus lime wedges for serving
- 1/2 small head cauliflower, cut into small florets
- One 15.5-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 1/2 cup cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped

## Steps

1. Heat the olive oil in a medium Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat. Add the leeks, carrots and potatoes. Season with 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, curry and cayenne. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is sizzling, about 1 minute. Stir in the coconut milk, vegetable broth and 4 cups water. Add the lime zest. Bring the soup to a rarpid simmer and cook until reduced slightly and the vegetables are almost tender, about 10 minutes.
2. Add the cauliflower and chickpeas. Continue to simmer rapidly until the vegetables are very tender and the soup is thick and flavorful, about 20 minutes more. Remove the lime zest. Season with salt and additional cayenne as needed. Stir in the lime juice and cilantro and serve with lime wedges.
