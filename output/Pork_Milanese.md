- **Prep:** 15 min
- **Cook:** 15 min

## Ingredients

- 1 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs)
- 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan
- 2 large eggs
- 6 boneless pork loin chops, pounded thin to 1/3 inch-thick (1 1/2 pounds total)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 6 lemon wedges

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.
2. Coarsely crush the panko into a large shallow bowl. Stir the cheese into the panko. Lightly beat the eggs in another large shallow bowl. Sprinkle the pork generously with salt and pepper. Dip the pork, 1 piece at a time, in the egg, allowing the excess to drip off, then dredge the pork in the crumb mixture, patting to coat completely. Place the pork on a small baking sheet.
3. Heat 1/4 cup of oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the pork to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain, then transfer them to a clean baking sheet and keep them warm in the oven. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil to the skillet and fry the remaining pork.
4. Transfer the pork to plates and serve with lemon wedges.
