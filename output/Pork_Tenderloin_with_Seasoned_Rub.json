    "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
    "1 teaspoon dried oregano",
    "1 teaspoon ground cumin",
    "1 teaspoon ground coriander",
    "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
    "Salt",
    "1 1/4 pounds pork tenderloin",
    "1 tablespoon olive oil",
    "1 teaspoon minced garlic"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.",
    "In separate bowl mix dry ingredients such as garlic powder, oregano, cumin, coriander, thyme and salt. Stir mixture with a fork until all the ingredients are well combined and they form a seasoning. This will be used as a rub to ensure the pork is well seasoned throughout. Sprinkle the rub over the tenderloin with a dry hand, then rub the pork with the seasoning over both sides of the meat, pressing gently so the seasoning adheres well to the tenderloin.",
    "In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and heat. Add the minced garlic and saute, stirring, for 1 minute. Put tenderloin in the pan and cook for about 10 minutes, searing each side using tongs to turn the meat. Transfer meat to a roasting pan and bake for 20 minutes. Slice and serve."
