- **Yields:** 2 servings
- **Total:** 25 min
- **Cook:** 25 min

## Ingredients

- One 14-ounce package firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, optional
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 scallions, thinly sliced, green and white parts separated
- 5 ounces fresh spinach, chopped (about 5 packed cups)
- 1 to 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped

## Steps

1. Combine the tofu, turmeric, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and cayenne, if using, in a medium bowl. Toss well to combine and set aside.
2. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the scallion whites and cook, stirring, until soft, about 1 minute. Add the tofu mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tofu is lightly browned and resembles scrambled eggs, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the spinach, lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir until the spinach is wilted, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and scallion greens and stir until the tomatoes are just heated through and begin to soften, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the basil and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
