  "ingredients": [
    "1/3 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging",
    "2 large eggs",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 1/2 cups fresh breadcrumbs",
    "1/4 teaspoon dried oregano",
    "1/4 teaspoon dried thyme",
    "4 bone-in pork chops, about 1/2-inch thick and patted dry (about 11/2 pounds total)",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil, for shallow frying",
    "Cooked spinach, for serving",
    "Lemon wedges, for serving"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Put the flour in a shallow dish. Break the eggs into another shallow bowl and whisk with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Mix the breadcrumbs with the oregano and thyme in a third shallow bowl.",
    "Dredge a pork chop in the flour, shaking off the excess, dip it into the eggs and then coat evenly with the breadcrumbs. Set aside on a piece of wax paper or baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.",
    "Heat a large skillet over medium heat with enough oil to come halfway up the sides of the chops (about 1/4 cup). When the oil shimmers, add the chops and fry until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels briefly. Serve hot with cooked spinach and lemon wedges."
