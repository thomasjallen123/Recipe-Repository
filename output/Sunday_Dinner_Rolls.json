  "ingredients": [
    "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast",
    "0.25 cup warm water",
    "1 pinch white sugar",
    "0.5 cup white sugar",
    "2 eggs",
    "1 cup warm water",
    "0.5 cup vegetable oil",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "4 cups all-purpose flour"
  ],
  "instructions": "In a large bowl, stir yeast, 1/4 cup warm water, and a pinch of sugar.\nIn another bowl, beat eggs in 1 cup warm water; add oil and salt. Mix egg mixture into yeast, and add sugar. Gradually add flour. Cover with a damp cloth, and allow to stand at room temperature for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator and allow to rise overnight. This dough is rather sticky, and will raise to at least twice it's size.\nDivide the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll each section out into a circle on a floured board or wax paper. Cut into pizza slice shapes, and roll slices large end to small end. Place on greased flat baking pans, and allow to rise for 2 hours.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 minutes.",
