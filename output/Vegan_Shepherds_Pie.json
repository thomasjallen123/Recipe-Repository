  "ingredients": [
    "1 1/2 pounds small creamer potatoes",
    "8 cloves garlic",
    "Kosher salt",
    "1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1/4 cup chopped chives",
    "Freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered",
    "1/4 cup tomato paste",
    "2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves, chopped",
    "1 1/4 cups vegetable or mushroom broth",
    "One 10-ounce bag frozen peas and carrots"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.",
    "Combine the potatoes and garlic in a medium saucepan and cover with 2 inches of water. Season generously with salt and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water and then drain the potatoes. Return the potatoes and garlic to the saucepan and mash with a potato masher. Add 1/2 cup of the cooking water and the 1/3 cup olive oil and stir to combine. If needed, stir in more water until the potatoes are a spreadable consistency. Stir in the chives and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and set the mashed potatoes aside.",
    "Pulse the mushrooms in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat until shimmering. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper and cook until all the moisture from the mushrooms has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and rosemary and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomato paste is a bit darker, about 3 minutes. Stir in the broth, followed by the peas and carrots and bring to a simmer, about 4 minutes.",
    "Remove from the heat, dollop all over with the mashed potatoes and spread the potatoes into an even layer with the back of a spoon or a spatula. Bake until golden on top and bubbling around the edges, about 25 minutes."
