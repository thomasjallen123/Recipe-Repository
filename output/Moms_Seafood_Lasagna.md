## Ingredients

- 2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 pound lump crabmeat
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups whole milk
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 1/2 cups shredded Romano
- One 15-ounce carton ricotta
- One 10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
- One 14-ounce can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella
- 1/2 cup Italian breadcrumbs
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest

- One 9-ounce package no-boil pasta noodles
- 1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella
- 1/2 cup shredded Romano
- Nonstick cooking spray, for the foil

## Steps

1. For the seafood: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
2. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shrimp, garlic and seafood seasoning and cook until the shrimp turn pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the shrimp from the skillet.
3. Add the wine and lemon juice to the skillet, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Bring to a simmer and cook until the mixture is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the shrimp and crabmeat.
4. Make the béchamel sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour until combined. Gradually add the milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Romano until melted. Set aside.
5. Make the spinach-artichoke ricotta: Stir together the ricotta, spinach, artichoke hearts, mozzarella, breadcrumbs, lemon zest and egg until combined. Season with salt. Fold in 1 cup of the béchamel sauce.
6. Assemble the lasagna: Spread about 1/2 cup of the béchamel sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with 3 to 4 lasagna noodles and about 2/3 cup béchamel sauce. Top with half of the spinach-artichoke ricotta and half of the seafood. Repeat the layers once. Top with the remaining 3 to 4 lasagna noodles and béchamel sauce. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and Romano.
7. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (coat with cooking spray before adding to the top to prevent the cheese from sticking). Bake, covered, until the lasagna is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until the noodles are tender and the top is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
