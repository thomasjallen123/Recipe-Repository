## Ingredients

- 3 to 3 1/2 pounds butternut squash, approximately 2, seeded and quartered
- Unsalted butter, melted, for brushing
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus 1 teaspoon
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper, plus 1/2 teaspoon
- 3 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

## Steps

1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Place the quartered squash onto a half sheet pan, brush the flesh of the squash with a little butter and season with 1 tablespoon of the salt and 1 teaspoon of the white pepper. Place in the oven and roast for 30 to 35 minutes or until the flesh is soft and tender.
3. Scoop the flesh from the skin into a 6-quart pot. Add the broth, honey and ginger. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer, approximately 7 to 8 minutes. Using a stick blender, puree the mixture until smooth*. Stir in the heavy cream and return to a low simmer. Season with the remaining salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
4. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.
