## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 1/3 pounds chicken breast tenders, cut into 1-inch pieces
- Salt and pepper
- 1 1/2 tablespoons butter
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 shallots, chopped
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1 cup chicken broth or stock
- 3 tablespoons capers, drained
- 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- 1 pound penne rigate pasta, cooked to al dente
- Chopped or snipped chives, for garnish

## Steps

1. Heat a deep nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and the chicken to the pan. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Brown chicken until lightly golden all over, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove chicken from pan and return the skillet to the heat. Reduce heat to medium. Add another tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter, the garlic and shallots to the skillet. Saute garlic and shallots 3 minutes. Add flour and cook 2 minutes. Whisk in wine and reduce liquid 1 minute. Whisk lemon juice and broth into sauce. Stir in capers and parsley. When the liquid comes to a bubble, add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to the sauce to give it a little shine. Add chicken back to the pan and heat through, 1 to 2 minutes. Toss hot pasta with chicken and sauce and serve. Adjust salt and pepper, to your taste. Top with fresh snipped chives.
