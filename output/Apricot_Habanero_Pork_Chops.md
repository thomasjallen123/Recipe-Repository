## Ingredients

- 4 bone-in center-cut pork chops
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup apricot preserves
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp grater
- 1 orange, zested and juiced
- 1/2 to 1 habanero pepper, seeded and diced
- Vegetable oil, for the grill grates
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
- 1 green apple, peeled, cored and finely diced
- 1 red bell pepper, finely diced
- 1 scallion, thinly sliced on the bias
- 1 lime, zested and juiced

## Steps

1. For the pork chops: Season the pork chops with salt and pepper; set aside while making the glaze.
2. Add the apricot preserves, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, orange zest and juice and habanero to a small pot and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the sauce is reduced and thickened, 10 to 15 minutes; let cool. Divide the glaze between 2 bowls, reserving 1 bowl for basting and one for serving with the cooked chops.
3. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Coat the grates with plenty of vegetable oil to help create a nonstick surface.
4. Using a brush, coat the chops with the first round of glaze. Place them on the grill glazed-side down and grill without moving until the glaze begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Brush the tops with glaze, flip the chops, brush the other side with more glaze and continue cooking until the chops are caramelized, charred and sticky and the internal temperature registers 135 degrees F, another 7 to 10 minutes. Discard the basting glaze. Let the chops rest for 5 to 10 minutes, coating them once with the reserved serving glaze while resting.
5. For the relish: Combine the mint, apple, bell pepper, scallion and lime zest and juice in a bowl and toss to coat.
6. Top the pork chops with some green apple relish and serve with the remaining serving glaze and relish.
