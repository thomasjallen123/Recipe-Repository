  "ingredients": [
    "1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta",
    "0.25 cup butter",
    "2 cloves garlic, minced",
    "2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry",
    "3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
    "salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
    "0.5 cup heavy cream",
    "1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta and cook, uncovered, for 4 to 5 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nWhile pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute.\nSlice any scallops over 3/4-inch thick in half so they'll cook evenly.\nStir scallops, basil, and parsley into the skillet. Cook and gently stir just until scallops feel slightly firm when pressed with a finger, about 2 to 3 minutes. Scallops will become tough and chewy if overcooked.\nReduce heat to low; stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Pour in cream if you like a thicker sauce and cook just until the sauce begins to simmer.\nLadle scallops and sauce over hot pasta and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top.",
