## Ingredients

- 2 cups raw peeled cashews
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1/4 cup organic refined coconut oil
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 3/4 cup cashew milk
- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
- Crackers, for serving

## Steps

1. Place the cashews in a bowl and cover with 4 cups water. Cover with plastic and soak 8 hours or up to overnight.
2. Drain the cashews and place in a high-powered blender with the lemon juice, coconut oil, salt, white pepper and 1/2 cup cashew milk. Blend the mixture, stirring as necessary. Add the remaining 1/4 cup cashew milk and blend until smooth. Stir in the parsley.
3. Fold the cheesecloth in half and line 2 small bowls with a piece of doubled cheesecloth, leaving enough overhang to cover the cashew mixture.
4. Divide the cashew mixture between the two bowls and cover completely with the cheesecloth. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 8 hours or up to overnight. Serve cold.
