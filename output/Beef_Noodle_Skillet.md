- **Cook:** 25 min

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound ground chuck
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 12 ounces egg noodles
- 2 1/2 cups beef broth
- 1 tablespoon grainy mustard
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- A few dashes Worcestershire sauce
- 1/3 cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

## Steps

1. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ground chuck and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook the meat, crumbling as you go, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for about 30 seconds.
2. Add the noodles, broth, 1 cup hot water, the mustard, paprika and Worcestershire sauce. Give a big stir and bring to a simmer. Cover and allow everything to simmer, stirring occasionally and adding up to 1/2 cup more water if necessary, until the pasta is al dente and the sauce has thickened, about 12 minutes. Stir in the sour cream and heavy cream and cook for 1 additional minute or until the pasta is tender.
3. Remove from the heat. Sprinkle over the chives and serve directly from the pan.
