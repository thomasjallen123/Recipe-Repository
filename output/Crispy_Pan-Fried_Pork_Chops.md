- **Yields:** 4 servings
- **Total:** 15 min
- **Cook:** 15 min

## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging
- 2 large eggs
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 cups fresh breadcrumbs
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 4 bone-in pork chops, about 1/2-inch thick and patted dry (about 11/2 pounds total)
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for shallow frying
- Cooked spinach, for serving
- Lemon wedges, for serving

## Steps

1. Put the flour in a shallow dish. Break the eggs into another shallow bowl and whisk with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Mix the breadcrumbs with the oregano and thyme in a third shallow bowl.
2. Dredge a pork chop in the flour, shaking off the excess, dip it into the eggs and then coat evenly with the breadcrumbs. Set aside on a piece of wax paper or baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat with enough oil to come halfway up the sides of the chops (about 1/4 cup). When the oil shimmers, add the chops and fry until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels briefly. Serve hot with cooked spinach and lemon wedges.
