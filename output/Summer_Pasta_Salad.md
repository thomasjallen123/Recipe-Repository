## Ingredients

- 1 pound gemelli or other twisted pasta, such as cavatappi
- 1 cup olive oil
- 1/3 cup red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon honey
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 Persian cucumbers, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced (about 2 cups)
- 2 pints mini heirloom cherry tomatoes or other cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 stalks celery, thinly sliced (about 1 cup)
- 2 cups radishes, thinly sliced
- 2 cups fresh corn kernels (from 4 about ears)
- 1 medium shallot, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)
- 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, roughly chopped
- 1/3 cup fresh dill, roughly chopped

## Steps

1. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain and rinse under cold running water to cool the pasta and stop the cooking process. Drain well and set aside.
2. Whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, mustard, honey, 2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Add the pasta, cucumbers, tomatoes, celery, radishes, corn, shallot, parsley and dill. Toss to combine and allow to marinate at room temperature for least 30 minutes or cover and refrigerate up to 8 hours. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve at room temperature.
