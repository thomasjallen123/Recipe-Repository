## Ingredients

- 8 cups chicken stock
- 6 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into large pieces
- 4 leeks (whites only), thoroughly washed and sliced
- 3 stalks celery, roughly chopped
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 cup heavy cream

## Steps

1. Put the chicken stock, potatoes, leeks, celery, bay leaf and thyme in a large pot and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Boil until the potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Remove the bay leaf. Using an immersion blender (or in batches in a blender or food processor), blend the soup until smooth. Pour the soup into a medium pot; add the cream and simmer until the soup has thickened, about 20 minutes.
