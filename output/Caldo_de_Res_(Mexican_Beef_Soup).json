Add oil, tilting the pan to coat the bottom. Add meat and bones and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until thoroughly browned.\nAdd onion and cook until lightly browned; stir in broth and tomatoes. The liquid should cover the bones by ½ inch.

Add carrots and 1/4 cup cilantro, and cook for 10 minutes. Stir in chayote, corn, and potato; simmer until vegetables are tender. Push cabbage wedges into soup; cook until tender, about 10 minutes.\nLadle soup into large bowls, including some meat, vegetables, and bones.\nGarnish with cilantro, jalapeños, and minced onion. Squeeze lime juice over soup and serve with radishes. Enjoy!",
