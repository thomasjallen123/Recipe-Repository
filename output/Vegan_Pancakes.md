- **Yields:** 6 pancakes
- **Total:** 45 min
- **Prep:** 10 min
- **Cook:** 35 min

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- Fine salt
- 1 1/2 cups unsweetened plain soy milk
- 1/3 cup virgin coconut oil, melted
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil
- Maple syrup, nut butter or jam, for serving

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the soy milk, coconut oil and vanilla in a second medium bowl (don't worry if the coconut oil clumps). Add the soy milk mixture to the flour mixture and gently fold until just combined (it's OK if there are lumps).
2. Heat a nonstick griddle or large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil. Once the pan is hot, add three 1/4-cup mounds of batter, evenly spaced, and cook until the pancakes begin to bubble and are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook until the underside is golden brown and the pancakes are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes (adjust the heat as necessary for consistent browning). Repeat with the remaining vegetable oil and batter. Transfer the cooked pancakes to the oven to keep warm. Serve 2 per person with maple syrup, nut butter, jam or your favorite topping.
