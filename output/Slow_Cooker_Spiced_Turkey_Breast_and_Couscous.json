  "ingredients": [
    "1 whole bone-in turkey breast (about 5 pounds)",
    "1 teaspoon ground coriander",
    "1 teaspoon ground cumin",
    "1 teaspoon paprika",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 cups butternut squash chunks (1 inch)",
    "1/3 cup dried apricots (about 2 ounces), coarsely chopped",
    "3 medium carrots (about 8 ounces), halved lengthwise, cut into 1-inch chunks",
    "3 large strips orange peel (removed with a vegetable peeler) plus 6 tablespoons orange juice",
    "2 dried bay leaves",
    "1 cinnamon stick",
    "1 medium onion, thickly sliced",
    "1 cup low-sodium chicken broth",
    "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "2 cups couscous",
    "1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Remove the skin from the turkey and trim away any excess fat. Use a sharp chef’s knife to cut out the backbone, leaving the turkey on the breast bones (this will help it fit in the slow cooker). Combine the coriander, cumin, paprika, ginger, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a small bowl. Rub the mixture all over the breast meat.",
    "Scatter the squash, apricots, carrots, orange peel, bay leaves, cinnamon stick and onion in the bottom of an 8-quart slow cooker. Pour in the broth and 1/4 cup of the orange juice. Stir in 1 1/4 teaspoons salt. Set the turkey breast-side up on top of the vegetables and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Cover and cook on low until the turkey reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 hours. Remove the turkey to a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes.",
    "Increase the slow cooker to high and cover just until the liquid is gently simmering again, about 2 minutes. Stir in the couscous, turn off the slow cooker, cover and let sit for 7 minutes. Uncover, fluff the couscous with a fork and stir in the cilantro. Discard the bay leaves and cinnamon stick and transfer the couscous to a serving bowl.",
    "Cut the turkey breast from the bone and slice against the grain into thick slices. Whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons orange juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Arrange the sliced turkey on a platter and drizzle over the sauce. Serve immediately."
