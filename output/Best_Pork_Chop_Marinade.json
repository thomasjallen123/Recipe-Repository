    "2 large pork chops",
    "0.25 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
    "4 cloves garlic, chopped",
    "3 tablespoons dark brown sugar",
    "2 tablespoons lemon juice",
    "2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard",

  "instructions": "Gather all ingredients.\nPlace pork chops on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the middle, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book.\nWhisk olive oil, garlic, brown sugar, lemon juice, mustard, thyme, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, mesquite seasoning, parsley, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag.\nAdd pork chops, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 6 to 8 hours.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chops from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.\nCook chops on the preheated grill until nicely browned on each side and slightly pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.",
