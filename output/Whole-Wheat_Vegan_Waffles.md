- **Yields:** 6 servings
- **Total:** 15 min
- **Cook:** 15 min

## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cups whole-wheat flour
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- Kosher salt
- 1 1/2 cups unsweetened soy milk (refrigerated, not shelf stable)
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- Cooking spray
- Maple syrup, nut butter or fruit preserves, for serving

## Steps

1. Preheat a waffle iron to medium-high. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F if using to keep cooked waffles warm.
2. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cornstarch and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the soy milk, oil and vanilla in a medium bowl. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and gently stir until just incorporated (it is OK if there are some lumps).
3. Generously spray the top and bottom of the waffle iron with cooking spray. Fill each compartment almost completely, and spread the batter to the edges. Close the lid and cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp, 6 to 7 minutes. Keep the cooked waffles warm in the oven or covered with foil on a plate while you make the remaining waffles. Serve with maple syrup, nut butter or fruit preserves.
