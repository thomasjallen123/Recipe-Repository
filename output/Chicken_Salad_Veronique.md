## Ingredients

- 4 split (2 whole) chicken breasts, bone-in, skin-on
- Good olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup good mayonnaise
- 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon leaves

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Place the chicken breasts, skin side up, on a sheet pan and rub them with olive oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Set aside until cool.
