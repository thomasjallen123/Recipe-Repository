  "ingredients": [
    "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note)",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "3 very ripe medium bananas, mashed (about 1 1/4 cups)",
    "3/4 cup sugar",
    "1/2 cup plain soy milk yogurt",
    "1/2 cup vegetable oil",
    "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners and set aside. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. Whisk the bananas, sugar, yogurt, oil and vanilla together in another medium bowl. Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until the batter just comes together (it's okay if there are lumps).",
    "Spoon about 1/4 cup of the batter into each lined muffin cup and bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool the muffins in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then remove muffins from pan and transfer to a rack to cool completely. Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days."
