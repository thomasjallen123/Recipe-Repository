  "ingredients": [
    "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note)",
    "7 1/2 teaspoons vegan granulated sugar",
    "1 tablespoon baking powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1 large very ripe banana, mashed (about 1/2 cup)",
    "1 1/4 cups unsweetened plain almond milk, at room temperature",
    "3 tablespoons unsalted vegan butter, such as Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks, melted and cooled, plus more for brushing and serving",
    "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
    "Maple syrup, for serving"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.",
    "Whisk the mashed banana, almond milk, butter and vanilla in a medium bowl until combined. Whisk the banana mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (it's OK if there are a few lumps).",
    "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and brush with butter. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet for each pancake and cook until the bottom is golden brown and bubbles form on top, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. (If the pancakes are browning too quickly, reduce the heat to medium-low.) Flip and continue cooking until golden brown on the other side, 1 to 2 more minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter, brushing the pan with more butter as needed. Serve with more butter and syrup."
