  "steps": [
    "Brush the grill with vegetable oil and preheat to medium high.",
    "Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil. When hot, add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Turn the heat off, then add the brandy. Turn the heat back on and cook until the brandy is reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add the diced tomatoes to the skillet with the sugar, crushed red pepper and a pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Meanwhile, sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt, 1/4 teaspoon each black pepper and lemon pepper and a pinch of kosher salt over one side of the steak.",
    "Put the steak on the hot grill seasoned-side down and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt, 1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and a pinch salt on the top of the steak and then flip it. Cook it for a further 3 to 4 minutes until medium rare. Remove to a board and rest while the sauce is finished.",
    "Reduce the heat to low under the sauce. Stir in the fontina and 1 tablespoon of the blue cheese. Stir in the cream and horseradish, then add in a little half-and-half if the sauce is too thick. Cook for a minute or two, tasting and adding more seasonings as needed.",
    "Meanwhile, cut the steak into 1/2-inch strips.",
    "At the last minute, add the spinach to the sauce and toss to coat. Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce. Mix everything together.",
    "Place the steak on top of the pasta. Garnish the dish with basil and the remaining 2 tablespoons blue cheese crumbles. Serve straight from the skillet."
