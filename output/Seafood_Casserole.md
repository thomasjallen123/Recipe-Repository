## Steps

1. For the casserole: Mix the shrimp, crabmeat, mayonnaise, lobster meat, celery, mustard, sherry, Worcestershire, seafood seasoning, salt, pepper, green onions, bell pepper and hot sauce in a large bowl. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Transfer to a medium-sized baking dish. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.
2. When ready, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
3. Top the casserole with the chips and bake until golden and heated through, about 30 minutes. Remove and let rest 5 to 7 minutes before serving.
4. For the simple green salad: Meanwhile, to a mason jar, add the olive oil, lemon juice, chives, honey, salt and pepper. Place the lid on the jar and shake to combine. Drizzle over the salad leaves in a bowl and toss.
5. Garnish the casserole with the chopped parsley and serve with the salad on the side.
