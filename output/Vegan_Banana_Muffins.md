- **Yields:** 12 muffins
- **Total:** 80 min
- **Cook:** 15 min

## Ingredients

- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 very ripe medium bananas, mashed (about 1 1/4 cups)
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup plain soy milk yogurt
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

## Steps

1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners and set aside. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. Whisk the bananas, sugar, yogurt, oil and vanilla together in another medium bowl. Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until the batter just comes together (it's okay if there are lumps).
2. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the batter into each lined muffin cup and bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool the muffins in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then remove muffins from pan and transfer to a rack to cool completely. Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
