- **Cook:** 10 min

## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried pinto beans, rinsed and picked over (see Cook’s Note)
- 48 ounces low-sodium chicken broth (or one 32-ounce carton plus 2 cups water)
- One 8-ounce jar mild or hot diced pickled jalapeños
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 1/4 cup cilantro leaves plus 1/4 cup chopped cilantro stems, optional
- Kosher salt
- 3/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar or crumbled Cotija or queso fresco
- 1 lime, cut into wedges

## Steps

1. Put the beans, chicken broth, pickled jalapeños and brine from the jar in a 4-to-7-quart slow cooker. Stir in the oregano, cumin, garlic, bay leaves, cilantro stems if using and 1 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook on high until the beans are tender but still hold their shape, 8 to 10 hours.
2. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Use the back of a spoon to smash the garlic cloves, then stir them into the beans. Serve topped with the cheese, cilantro leaves and lime wedges.
